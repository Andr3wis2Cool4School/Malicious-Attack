So emergency would be appropriate, for example in case of cabin decompression, right ?@PascalSyn that's just for the high@damienramage @airlivenet That would certainly explain why pilots set steap descend.

They started steep descend, reduced engine... #4U9525@PascalSyn @airlivenet real question is, how long before the crash did they call out the emergency@airlivenet @PollyR_Aviation is that a normal call in this situation ?@PascalSyn @airlivenet if they had, it’s likely the descent rate would’ve been steeper and the speed not reduce, no ?@PascalSyn @airlivenet but isn’t declaring an emergency the proper procedure if you still have control of the situation ?@damienramage yes, and they have a bottle behind them with this tube connected.

I just ponder the facts....which is absolutely no proof that you're intelligent at all, of course @g_kearnan @DailyMirror.@Soultrexon cheersHaha. In the sense of ""split"", right @g_kearnan @DailyMirror? But you're in Scotland, right? It's the German meaning that's relevant.You'd have to ask that to the mom of the ex-classmate @parMaster @DailyMirror. I bet they'd come up with a theory.@Soultrexon @DailyMirror nope. Im in austria...@Soultrexon @DailyMirror ur entitled to ur opinion as I am entitled to mine! And mine says evil nasty man!so sad !!!  if u wanna kill ur self,  then that's YOUR CHOICE,  but why take innocent ppl with u.

You're inoffensive and statistically not likely to blow a fuse over a caricature for dumb minds @g_kearnan @DailyMirror.Depressive, as per the mom of one of his ex-classmate from long time ago @jopel69 @DailyMirror. Not evil. Your response is irrational.@Soultrexon @DailyMirror I'm a Scot who's lived in Austria for 10 years...@Soultrexon @DailyMirror you have no idea how personally popular he was here. The adulation.Absolutely, @jopel69. And quite a huge diversity of sicknesses, all coming at you in a full palette of colours, scents, essences and forms!@DailyMirror @KenyanTraffic Why do these depressed people try to take out others at the same time?  A planeload or a family?  Its demonic.Could be @g_kearnan @DailyMirror. I knew him only through hearsays.Can I ask you a perhaps indiscreet question @g_kearnan @DailyMirror? What did you think of him at that time?@DailyMirror didn't you hear the n-word on the cockpit voice records?@Soultrexon @DailyMirror more in terms of.. ""sectioned under the mental health act""...  Rubber wallpaper time...Why do you believe I care, @jopel69? Are you so arrogant and cocksure as to think you can read my mind?@Soultrexon don't recall hearing that but his party seems to have moved its focus to Vienna...I have an idea @g_kearnan @DailyMirror. I had an Austrian girlfriend back then.Exact @g_kearnan. And nicknamed the Lone Wolf there, isn't it?That answer is more intelligent than the whole Daily Mirror article, @g_kearnan @DailyMirror. We?  You're German? Highly suspicious!@DailyMirror if u want to commit suicide that's ur choice but all those poor innocent people/children &amp; babies had NO choice! Evil person 😡@Soultrexon @DailyMirror he was clever and charismatic and he was screwed over by the leader of the conservatives.@Soultrexon he was governor of carinthia, a province notorious for it's protection of old Nazis...3 things I do appreciate indeed @g_kearnan. Gotta go. Happy trails!@Soultrexon there's some sick people in this world 😡👊I see, @DailyMirror. I suppose the mother of this ex-classmate is an extremely reliable source, and her daughter too? Your post is baloney.@Soultrexon @DailyMirror often ""burnout"" here means ""sectioned""@Soultrexon why do u care? I don't care for ur opinion or facts! I say what I say end of!@Soultrexon @DailyMirror funnily enough I met him a few days before... In a Salzburg beer hall...Vienna. I heard so much about this city @g_kearnan.
